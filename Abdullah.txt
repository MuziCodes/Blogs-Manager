Why scheduling is important
By having your schedule at the top of your mind, your calendar acts as a filter against distractions.~If someone comes up to you while you're working, you can ask them to come back later when you've finished a scheduled piece of work.~When you know that you've a set amount of scheduled time to do something, it allows you to stay focused so you can get everything done within a specific time.~If you don't, you're going to have to reschedule everything.
